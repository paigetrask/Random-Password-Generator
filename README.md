Random Password Generator.
This is an app built using JS, HTML and CSS based on a Figma design file, that generates random passwords. 
When the user clicks the button four different random passwords are created. 
The user can choose how long they want their password to be, but it must be between 6-18 characters.
If the user tries to make a password length outside of this range a reminder message pops up.![0EF38491-B65D-4504-8C49-804D8A799D13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85037570/175428163-6644473d-09d5-426d-a6d7-7b953ae461bf.jpeg)
